## Getting Started

### Technical Requirements

All projects require a modern web browser with support for:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations)
- JavaScript ES6+
- WebGL capabilities

Some projects may have additional requirements:
- Node.js and npm for build tools
- Specific APIs or services

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory you want to work on
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server (if applicable):
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Projects

### 1. Interactive Particle Simulator

[View Documentation](docs/particle-simulator/README.md)

Features:
- Realistic particle physics simulation with gravity, collisions, and constraints
- Customizable particle properties (mass, charge, velocity)
- Shader-based rendering for smooth visuals
- Interactive controls to modify simulation parameters in real-time

### 2. Dynamic Data Visualization Dashboard

[View Documentation](docs/data-visualization/README.md)

Features:
- Real-time data feeds from public APIs (e.g., financial markets, weather)
- Animated charts and graphs with smooth transitions
- Customizable dashboard layout with drag-and-drop widgets
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

### 3. Procedural Landscape Generator

[View Documentation](docs/landscape-generator/README.md)

Features:
- Procedurally generated terrains using noise algorithms (Perlin, Simplex)
- Interactive zoom/pan controls to explore the landscape
- Dynamic lighting and shadows via shaders
- Export functionality for generated landscapes as images

### 4. AI-Powered Chatbot Interface

[View Documentation](docs/chatbot-interface/README.md)

Features:
- Stylish chat interface with animated typing effects
- AI conversation handling with natural language processing
- Contextual responses and memory of previous interactions
- Customizable themes and emoji support

### 5. Interactive Music Visualizer

[View Documentation](docs/music-visualization/README.md)

Features:
- Real-time audio analysis using the Web Audio API
- Dynamic light patterns that react to music frequency spectrum
- Customizable visual styles via shader parameters
- Support for user-uploaded audio files or streaming radio

## Shared Resources
