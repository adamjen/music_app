# Music Visualizer Development Tasks

This directory contains numbered Jira tasks for developing the music visualizer application. Each task is designed to be implemented by a junior developer and builds upon the previous tasks.

## Task Overview

1. **Project Structure**: Set up basic project files and directories
2. **HTML Structure**: Create HTML skeleton with canvas element
3. **CSS Styling**: Add basic styling for interface elements
4. **Audio Controls**: Implement UI controls for audio sources
5. **Web Audio API**: Set up audio processing pipeline
6. **Canvas Visualization**: Basic frequency visualization using 2D context
7. **GLSL Shaders**: Add WebGL and shader support
8. **Shader Visualization**: Create advanced visualizations with shaders
9. **Shader Presets**: Implement multiple shader effects that can be switched
10. **Advanced Audio**: Add sophisticated audio processing features
11. **Testing & Debugging**: Test functionality across platforms and fix issues

## Implementation Order

Tasks should generally be implemented in numerical order, as each builds upon the previous one. However, some tasks may be worked on concurrently (e.g., CSS styling while setting up Web Audio API).

## Task Details

Each task file contains:
- A description of what needs to be implemented
- Specific requirements and technical details
- Acceptance criteria for verifying completion
- Example code snippets where applicable

## Getting Started

To begin development:

1. Create a new `music-visualizer` directory in the project root
2. Start with Task 1 (Project Structure)
3. Follow the task sequence, implementing each feature step-by-step
4. Test regularly to catch issues early
5. Refer to the main project README for overall architecture and design guidance

## Contributing

If you have ideas for additional tasks or improvements:

1. Create a new task file with the next available number (e.g., `tasks/12-task-name.md`)
2. Follow the same format as existing tasks
3. Include clear requirements, acceptance criteria, and examples
