## Task 11: Testing and Debugging

**Description**: Test all features and fix any issues that arise.

**Requirements**:
- Test with various audio file formats
- Test on different browsers and devices
- Check performance under heavy load
- Fix any visual or audio glitches
- Ensure responsive behavior across screen sizes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All basic functionality works as expected
- No major bugs or crashes
- Performance is acceptable for target hardware
- Visualizations are smooth and consistent
- All UI controls function properly

**Example Testing Plan**:
1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Test audio playback from file input
   - Test radio stream functionality
   - Verify shader presets switch correctly
   - Check different audio modes work properly

2. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop)
   - Mobile browsers (iOS/Android)

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Monitor FPS during intense visualizations
   - Test with high-resolution shaders
   - Optimize code for smoother performance

4. **Responsiveness Testing**:
   - Verify layout on different screen sizes
   - Check touch compatibility on mobile devices

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Test with unsupported audio formats
   - Handle WebGL not being available
   - Graceful degradation when features aren't supported
