## Priority Recommendations

1. **Create script.js file** with the Web Audio API integration as the first priority
2. **Implement audio control functionality** before moving to more complex features
3. **Develop basic canvas visualization** to verify the Web Audio API pipeline works
4. **Focus on completing early tasks** (1-6) before starting advanced shader work

## Notes for Developers

- The current state suggests we're at an early stage of implementation
- HTML and CSS are mostly complete, but JavaScript functionality is missing
- Placeholder files exist in audio/ directory that should be developed further
- Shaders/ directory has placeholder GLSL files waiting for integration
- Test early and often to catch integration issues between components

## Next Steps

1. **Create script.js** with basic Web Audio API setup
2. **Implement audio control handlers**
3. **Add canvas visualization logic**
4. **Test the pipeline before moving to advanced features**

This gap analysis provides a clear roadmap for completing the music visualizer project.
